  I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. student in [Biomedical Data Science](https://biostat.wisc.edu/) at UWâ€“Madison. I specialize in causal inference with particular interests in instrumental variables estimation. I'm also interested in making causal inference more robust and efficient with modern machine learning methods.
