intro: |
  I'm a fourth-year PhD student in [Biomedical Data Science](https://biostat.wisc.edu/) at UW–Madison. I specialize in causal inference with particular interests in instrumental variables estimation. I'm also interested in making causal inference more robust and efficient with modern machine learning methods and the semiparametric theory. My advisor is [Prof. Lu Mao](https://sites.google.com/view/lmaowisc/home).
