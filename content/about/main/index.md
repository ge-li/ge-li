intro: |
  I'm a PhD candidate in Biostatistics [(Biomedical Data Science)](https://biostat.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin—Madison. My research primarily focuses on causal inference, semiparametric theory, clinical trials, and statistical methods for anomaly/risk detection (central statistical monitoring). I'm also enthusiastic about developing statistical software and data visualization in R. My advisor is [Prof. Lu Mao](https://sites.google.com/view/lmaowisc/home).
  
  My professional experience includes internships at Gilead Sciences and research roles at UW-Madison. I've contributed significantly to R projects such as <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>[{gsm}](https://github.com/Gilead-BioStats/gsm), <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>[{robustGMM}](https://github.com/ge-li/robustGMM), <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>[{complyr}](https://github.com/ge-li/complyr), and <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>[{upim}](https://github.com/ge-li/upim). Additionally, I possess strong proficiency in programming languages and tools like Python (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch) and SQL.
